Import the Libraries needed for creating the model. 
Import the  bank churn modelling dataset to the notebook.
Display the columns independent Vs. dependent variables.
Dependent variable is Y.
Carry out an EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).
A histogram will show the distribution across the dataset. 
Percentage of subscriptions will be shown. 
Create the logistic regression model.
A numerical value will be assigned to each category. The rows with categories will be transformed to multiple columns.
Check the outcome variable counts to make sure about the imbalance i.e if outcome variable shows high percentage of one class when compared to other.
Split the dataset to test and train data. The model can be created on the train dataset and then tested on the test dataset.
Predict the test dataset.
